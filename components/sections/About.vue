        Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My
        interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom
        Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot
        about HTML &amp; CSS!
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
          Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at
          <a class="font-medium text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300" href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/">an advertising agency</a>,
          <a href="https://starry.com/">a start-up</a>,
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/">a huge corporation</a>, and
          <a href="https://scout.camd.northeastern.edu/">a student-led design studio</a>. My
          main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
          experiences at <a href="https://upstatement.com/">Upstatement</a> for a variety of
          clients.
        </p>

          I also recently
          <a href="https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app">
            launched a course
          </a>
          that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node
          &amp; React.
