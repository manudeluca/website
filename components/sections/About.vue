        My interest in development began in 2014 when I created a management system on "Fantacalcio" with Excel, discovering the formulas mentally trained me for programming. <br>
        After graduating with a degree in computer science, I had the privilege of building software for three web agencies, two start-ups and a financial consulting company.

        Today my main focus is building the <a class="font-medium text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300" href="https://allyfe.health" target="_blank">Allyfe</a> platform. I like to build software that is solid under the hood but also beautiful to look at. <br>
        In my spare time I like to develop personal projects to learn or improve a programming language.

        When I'm not at the computer, I'm at the gym, going to the stadium, or hanging out with my friends, maybe traveling around the world.
